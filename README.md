# Advanced Feature Management with Feature Filters in ASP.NET Core

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to implement advanced feature management in an ASP.NET Core application using feature filters. By leveraging feature filters, you can enable or disable features based on specific conditions such as user claims, providing a tailored experience for different user segments.
This repository is a central hub for every feature, technique, and approach I introduce on LinkedIn. It serves as a practical, hands-on resource where you can explore, test, and implement advanced concepts in .NET and ASP.NET Core. Each technique is demonstrated with full code examples, , and real-world use cases.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to test the advanced feature management and VIP feature filtering:

### Step 1: Generate a JWT Token

To test the feature filter vip message, you need to generate a JWT token with a user claim indicating whether the user is a VIP. Use the following credentials:

- **Username**: `vipuser`
- **Password**: `vippassword`

### Step 2: Send a Request to the API

Once you have the JWT token, send a request to the `/custom-greeting` API endpoint. Include the generated JWT token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

### Example Request

```http
GET /custom-greeting
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>
